# Cognitive Services Workshop

This repository contains two complete samples showing how to use the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api) in a website, one written in C# using ASP.NET Core and the other written in Node.js using Express and Pug as the view engine.

Both versions of this workshop walk you through how to make the api call, parse the JSON response, and choose which character of The Office you are based on your emotion in the photo you provided. This workshop is meant to be a jumping off point to get you started with Cognitve Services, so feel free to customize your site at the end and make it your own!
